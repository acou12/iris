## Developing

Run `npm run dev` to start the development server. Any file changes will be reflected in the browser through hot-reloading.

## Ideas

- Exercise system
- Section links
  - Unique, short idenfier for each section (like a real textbook)
    - Traditional 1, 1.1, 1.1.1, ..., 2, ...
    - Distinguishing code
      - GA1, GA2.3, (for graph algorithms)
- Collapsable optional sections (examples, applications, remarks, asides, tangents, anecdotes, rants, pedantry, contemplation, historical background, trivia, poetry...)
- Text selection actions (highlight, define, feedback [link to issue creation])
- WebGL primative renderer
- Figure settings
  - Save as image
  - Save short interaction as GIF
  - Reduced animation mode
  - Color-deficiency accessibility
    - Use patterns instead of colors (perhaps a general framework for this?)
- No-script support
  - Screenshots of figures as a substitute
    - (can this be done automatically?)
- Offline support
  - Download article/subject/website as HTML for reading in browser
  - PWA cache thing?
  - Download as PDF (with figure substitutions)
