# Introduction

Graphs are everywhere. They represent relationships between pairs of data points.

# Definitions

The abstract, mathematical definition of a graph.

# Applications

Some things that graphs can represent.

## Geography

Places can be represented by nodes, and edges are ways to transport between close places. A path is a literal, physical path between two places.

## Social Networks

People are represented by nodes, and edges are social connections between people (friendships, familial relationships). Paths here are more abstract, but they could represent paths through people that information could travel along.
