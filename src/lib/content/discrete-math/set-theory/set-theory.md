# An Introduction to Sets

A very useful concept in mathematics is the idea of the **set**. A set is essentially a collection of items. Here are some examples of sets:

$$
\{ 1, 2, 3 \} \tag{1}
$$

<!-- $$
\{ \text{apple}, \text{banana}, \text {orange}\} \tag{2}
$$ -->

$$
\{ f, g, h \} \tag{3}
$$

Set $(1)$ is a set of the first three natural numbers, set $(2)$ is a set of fruits, and set $(3)$ is a set of mathematical functions.

# Set Operations

It is often useful to perform operations on sets to compare them.

The **intersection** of two sets is a new set that contains elements that are only in both sets. This is denoted using the $\cap$ symbol. For example,

$$
\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12\} \cap \{3, 6, 9, 12\} = \{6, 12\}
$$

The **union** of two sets is a new set that contains elements that are in _either_ set. This is denoted using the $\cup$ symbol. For example,

$$
\{1, 2, 3\} \cup \{3, 4, 5\} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}
$$
